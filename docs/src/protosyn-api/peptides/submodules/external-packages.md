# [External packages](@id peptides-external-packages)

> The [External packages](@ref peptides-external-packages) is a submodule of `ProtoSyn.Peptides` module. As such, the following section introduces both new types and methods that work together, in a generally independent way from the rest of the module, and require an unique exploratory section on their own.

As futher explained in the Core module [External packages](@ref external-packages) section, ProtoSyn makes available tools to define and manipulate input structures for common and useful external packages.

## Gromacs

For the Gromacs simulation suite, the Peptides module introduces methods to define .itp files for protein structures, as well as manipulate the [`Pose`](@ref) graph to match both the [`Atom`](@ref) names and [`Atom`](@ref) order expected by Gromacs.
