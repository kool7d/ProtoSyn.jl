using SIMD

# ! Note:
# When applying SIMD optimizations, it is possible to use 8 Float32 numbers in a
# single modern register (256 bits). With the right vector suffle operations
# this allows for the quick calculation of 8 inter-atomic euclidean distances in
# a single vector. However, SIMD vectors are not iterable → a single operation
# must be applied to all the data. For this reason, conditional potentials, such
# as the flat-bottom potential, are hard to apply in SIMD mode (the actual
# potential to be applied depends on the distance). An option, in these cases,
# is to use a mask for each of the domains in the flat-bottom potential,
# applying each sub-potential only to the distances in that given domain (the
# un-masked distances). In the current organization of ProtoSyn, that would
# require the existance of multiple potential methods → one whose argument is a
# single float (as in SISD_0 and CUDA_2 modes) and another whose argument is a
# SIMD vector. However, when looping over the atom interactions, in most use
# cases the number of interactions with any given atom is not a multiple of 8,
# and there there is a number of "left over" interaction to calculate. The most
# simple approach is to deal with these interactions one-at-a-time. Using this
# approach instead of employing the SIMD potential method, we now require the
# original 1-on-1 SIMD/CUDA potential. Providing both potentials to the
# `resolve_calculation` bellow is not feasible in the current architecture of
# ProtoSyn. Another option is to include "fake interactions" to fill the
# remaining slots in an 8 float32 register, which are later ignored. Moreover,
# for a correct calculation of the forces felt on each interacting atom, the
# displacement vector v must be normalized. Since the vector length is being
# calculated in the calculation stage, the potential function already receives a
# normalized vector. For modularity, non pre-normalized vectors can be used,
# with the addition of the `is_normalized` flag. In the case of it being set to
# false, the normalization is done during the potential application.
