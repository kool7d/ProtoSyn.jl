    "\n",
    "One of the main applications of ProtoSyn is the easy manipulation of molecular structures: add and remove residues and whole loops, mutate aminoacids, bond and unbond atoms or completly remove them from the structure. These are just some examples of the manipulations possible with the ProtoSyn framework. In the next examples we will explore a few of these tasks. Despite most of the methods used in this example having a Core counter-part, for this example, we will focus on the Peptides module, as it provides specialized methods for dealing with peptidic chains. We will start by creating a new Pose from scratch, employing the `build` function from the `Builder` submodule."

Multiple instances of such libraries have been proposed in the past. ProtoSyn employs, by default, the Dunbrack Rotamer Library 2011, a backbone-dependent library. This means that available rotamers for a given aminoacid's sidechain are restricted by the current backbone phi and psi dihedral angles, based on the observed probabilities in nature. In ProtoSyn, a user is able to load this rotamer library and explore it freely to apply a new rotamer to a given sidechain, as exemplified bellow."
